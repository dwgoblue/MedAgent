To this end, we probed\n  3-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)acrylic acid (MONACRA) as a potential\n  CYP4A11 substrate. We studied its metabolism using human liver\n  microsomes (HLM) and recombinant P450 enzymes. O-demethylation of\n  MONACRA by cytochromes P450 creates 3-(6-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)acrylic\n  acid.
